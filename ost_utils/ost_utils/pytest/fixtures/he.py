# lago uses a simple scheme to do 1-1 mapping of IPv4 address
# to MAC address and to IPv6 address. So in theory we could have
# only the IPv4 address hard-coded and have the others calculated -
# either calling lago (internal?) functions or duplicating here the
# calculation. But I think hard-coding everything is enough in this
# case, and also makes it much easier to grep for stuff later.
# As-is, the constants below match what lago would have done when supplied
# with only the IPv4 address 192.168.200.99 and calculating IPv6 and MAC
# based on it. In principle, since we now do not rely on lago for this,
# we could use other random addresses. TODO: generalize this, also for
# allowing to run more than one copy of OST on the same machine (so at
# least one copy will not be able to use 192.168.200), and perhaps also
# allow doing this completely random - just pick a random MAC address,
# let dhcp (libvirt) allocate appropriate IPv4/IPv6 addresses based on
# the subnet, and use that.
